"""
The Problem,

A python script that can download the PDF's for each month/year from the ttb.gov website.

Be nice to this website and limit your script to only 5 pdf's until it's working.

Use the disk to cache the pages and pdf's so you aren't hammering the website.
This also helps you work quicker since you aren't waiting for the internet.

Once you're able to reliable get all the PDF's, you should integrate
your statistics extraction from the previous exercise to produce full statistics.

It might be time to officially create a project and write automated tests for your code.
The next exercise will require you to wrewrite some of this, so having tests will make this quicker and easier.

To accomplis this problem you'll need some basics:

1. How to download a URL.
2. Saving it to disk so you don't have to rely on the network while you work.
3. Loading it with BeautifulSoup library.
4. How to use "with".
